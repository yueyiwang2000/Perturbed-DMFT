before running:
    "Norder"    : 3,                # the maximum perturbation order
  "N_min_order" : 2,                # the minimal order at which we run MC (the rest analytic)

  usually N_min_order is 2. and if Norder is more than 2, there are some Monte carlo.
  The tricky point is if this is purely analytic, files are called .OCA, like Gf.OCA Sig.OCA
  and if there are MC, they are called as .out, like Gf.out and Sig.out

  seems there are some bugs if we want to go to high orders...?
  2,3 is okay,
  2,4 breaks down
  3,4 works.
  4,4 is also okay, and at (U=5,T=.3 it already shows PM, which is good.)
  4.5 is probably okay in principle but it requires more than 100 PPSigmas and the code will quit automatically, which is not okay.
  3,5 seems also works. a little slow but nice.
  2,5 is bad. same reason as 4,5.
  2,4 works again? maybe I did not clean some of the files before.

  Kristjan said N_min_order is at most 2. Let's say we use 2,4 or 2,3.
  2,3 does not tend to give PM at U=5,T=.3. It looks not good enough.  Let's stick to 2,4.

  I do not understand why sometimes it works but sometimes not....why?
  maybe it's because files in previous run is not completely deleted.
